Good day, my name is Boushra Bettir and I love to code websites and games. 
Please note that all the sprites present in both these games are not my own. All sprites come from Itch.io.

My experience in games:
  - Unity 2D (C#)
  - C++
  
Goals (2022-2023):
  - Reach an understanding of C++ Game Physics
  - Understand how to use a 3D engine more
  - Become more proficient in the languages stated above
  - Have a complete understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms along with Databases

Take a look around!
